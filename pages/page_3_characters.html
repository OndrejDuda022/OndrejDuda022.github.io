                        <p>Mettora is scientifically and technologically oriented. She is interested in machines, and after gaining enough fame and power, she manages to take Paradis Island to a much higher technological level than it is in the original series. 
                        She "invents" many useful machines to help humanity fight the titans, ranging from steam-powered vehicles to airships and more. She establishes a team of engineers, working closely with the Scout Regiment, 
                        and earns the title of "Head Engineer of Eldia".</p>

                        <p>Story: Demon Slayer</p>
                        <p>Quick Lore:</p>
                        <p>Mettysan was an average human who tried to become a celebrity, but was unsuccessful. One night he was cornered by a group of street thieves. 
                        They would have killed him, however they were themselves killed by a passing demon Douma. He offered to turn him into a demon as well. 
                        Mettysan accepted this offer, and his Demon Blood Art soon evolved and connected with a revolutionary new invention, the radio. 
                        That's how he got the title "Radio Demon". Still, he wasn't looking for power among the demons, and thus escaped the attention of both Muzan and the Demon Slayers. 
                        It was only after the demon Gyokko was killed that Muzan turned his attention to him and offered him the vacant position of Upper Five moon.</p>

                        <p>Story: Inheritance Cycle</p>
                        <p>Quick Lore:</p>
                        <p>Maviel is the youngest of the Meloria, an ancient star-born race. They are a race of immense power, harnessing the primal energy of the universe, allowing them to shape reality itself to their whims. 
                        However, they have realized that for reality's continued evolution, they must vanish from the scene and become mere observers, quietly safeguarding its progress from within the shadows.
                        Maviel was born after this, and was the only one of the Meloria who did not get a chance to fully enjoy his powers. Despite having lived for over millennia, he still has a childlike playful nature due to the slow maturation of his race.
                        So one day he breaks the oath of non-interference and sets out to Alagaësia with the intention of playing the adventures that he has only been allowed to observe until now.</p>

                        <p>Story: Neon Genesis Evangelion</p>
                        <p>(*WIP) Quick Lore:</p>
                        <p>Matarael (Matteo for short) is to replace the original 9th Angel. Like Kaworu, he chooses a more human-like form, blending in without NERV noticing.
                        He has a more peculiar aura, though he tries to be polite and unnaturally obliging. He shows interest and curiosity about the human race, especially the psyche.
                        One rainy day, he approaches Shinji as he walks home from school alone, probably out of pure interest. After a brief dialogue filled with hints that nothing is as it seems, Matteo reveals his identity and lets Shinji escape and alert NERV. 
                        When he is discovered and Evangelion units are sent to destroy him, he reveals his larger angelic form, looking like a black-grey helmetless replica of Eva Unit with a human head, and almost manages to break through to the geofront, 
                        but in the end he ends up like all other Angels.</p>
